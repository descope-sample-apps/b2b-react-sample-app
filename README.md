#### 3. Install dependencies 

You can use npm or yarn, but we recommend using yarn. If it isn't already installed on your machine, the instructions on how to do so can be found [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/). After yarn is installed, run this command:
```
yarn install
```

#### 4. Start the app

Run this command to start the app:

```
yarn start
```

#### 5. Open the app
Browse to `http://localhost:3000`


##### User invitation with Magic Link
This app contains a user invitation route that uses a magic link.
To use it, go to your [project configuration](https://app.descope.com/settings/project) and do the following
 - Set the "User Invitation Redirect URL" to a URL with the path of `auth/invitation` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/auth/invitation`)
 - Check the Add a "Magic Link token to the invitation link" checkbox, so that the token is sent in the invitation email

## Testing
To run Cypress E2E tests:
```
yarn run cypress open
```

## Other Configuration

### Management Widgets & SSO Setup

To test `Management Widgets` or `SSO Setup` functionality, you'll need to have a user configured with a tenant and the `Tenant Admin` role assigned.
